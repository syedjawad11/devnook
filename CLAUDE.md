# DevNook — Claude Session Log (Dev Workspace)

> Always read this file first at the start of a new session. Updated at end of every session.
> **Content pipeline lives in `../devnook_content_workspace/`** — no pipeline code or registry in this repo.

## Session start — do NOT auto-read these files

Unless explicitly asked, do not open:

- `archives/decisions-archive.md` (on demand only)
- Prior chat transcripts or session history

Start each session from this file + MEMORY.md only.

## Project Overview

**DevNook** (devnook.dev) — developer resource site, 1,000+ programmatic posts + 18 client-side browser tools, monetized via AdSense (deferred until 50k visitors/month).

**Stack:** Astro + Cloudflare Pages. Content is published by `../devnook_content_workspace/` via PAT.
**Repo:** `main` branch, Cloudflare Pages auto-deploy on every push.

## Last Session (2026-04-25, #28)

**Status:** ✅ Cross-repo CI live + devnook repo cleaned of pipeline code.

### What was done

- **Phase 7 — Content workspace CI live**: pushed `../devnook_content_workspace/` to `github.com/syedjawad11/devnook-content` (private). Configured `GH_PAT` and `DEVNOOK_REPO_PAT` secrets. `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` deferred — `publish.py` has a guard that skips GSC ping when unset. `on-demand-publish.yml` run #3 verified green (20s): published `how-to-check-regex-pattern-in-javascript.md` to devnook via cross-repo git push.
- **Repo rename**: GitHub site repo renamed `DevNook-` → `devnook` (trailing hyphen was breaking workflow `repository:` references). Local remote URL updated. PAT re-scoped to new name.
- **Phase 6 — Pipeline code removed from devnook**: `b420443` deleted `agents/{content-team,publish,utils,tools-team,dev-team}/`, `agents/{__init__.py,requirements.txt,skills/__init__.py}`, 4 stale skill markdown files, 6 stale subagent prompts, `content-staging/`, `templates/`, and `.github/workflows/{drip-publish,on-demand-publish}.yml`. 133 files, build verified at 72 pages.

### Next session priorities (#29)

1. **Verify scheduled drip** — daily cron at 08:00 UTC. Watch tomorrow's run land 3 posts.
2. **Verify sitemap in GSC** — resubmit `https://devnook.dev/sitemap-index.xml`
3. **Optional cleanup** — delete `link_utility.py` + dormant linker tests after another week of stable plugin operation

### Deferred (do not do)

- **AdSense integration** — revisit only at 50k visitors/month
- Blog filter chips wiring (decorative only)
- Search bar wiring (`SearchBar.astro` parked)

## Key Paths

- Astro site: `src/`
- Layouts: `src/layouts/`
- Content: `src/content/` (written by content workspace publisher)
- Components: `src/components/`
- Global styles: `public/styles/` (NOT src/styles/)
- Tools: `src/pages/tools/[slug].astro` + `public/tools/*.html`
- Auto-internal-links plugin: `src/plugins/auto-internal-links/index.mjs`
- Dev subagent: `agents/subagent-prompts/builder.md`
- Dev skills: `agents/skills/astro-conventions.md`, `agents/skills/tool-build-patterns.md`

---

## Dev Subagent

```
ORCHESTRATOR (Sonnet main session)
  └── Builder (Sonnet) — agents/subagent-prompts/builder.md
      Handles: Astro edits, new tools, npm run build verification
```

Spawn with: `Agent(prompt=open('agents/subagent-prompts/builder.md').read(), ...)`

**Workflow B** — new tool: Orchestrator → Builder → review + commit
**Workflow C** — bug fix: Orchestrator → Builder → review + commit

## Important Decisions Log

> Live guardrails — if you forget these, you will break something.

| Decision | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| No Tailwind | All styles in `tokens.css` custom properties |
| All tools client-side only | 18 tools, no Workers, no AI-powered tools |
| Static output (not hybrid) | `output: 'static'`, no adapter — satori crashes Workers runtime |
| Global CSS in `public/styles/` not `src/styles/` | Astro only copies `public/` to `dist/`; absolute `/styles/*` refs need public/ |
| PostCard prop is `href` not `slug` | All 5 call sites use `href`; never rename to slug/url/path |
| `tools/[slug].astro` uses `import.meta.glob` | Dynamic `await import()` crashes Vite static analysis |
| Never call `build-tool.py build_tool()` for existing tools | Writes page that collides with dynamic route — use `generate_seo_explainer()` + `write_file()` |
| Auto internal links plugin (rehype, build-time) | `src/plugins/auto-internal-links/index.mjs`; `autoAnchors: true`; `devnookUrlBuilder` required — language concept URLs use `frontmatter.language`+`frontmatter.concept`, NOT filename |
| Use `@astrojs/sitemap@3.2.1` not custom | Custom sitemap was broken; v3.7+ incompatible with Astro 4.x. Current version generates `sitemap-0.xml` (0-indexed) — do not expect `sitemap-1.xml` |
| Related posts auto-derived at render time (session 27) | `src/layouts/PostLayout.astro` builds the related list from `getCollection()` using a language/category/tags score — never from a hand-written `## Related` markdown section. `frontmatter.related_posts` is unused; leave as `[]`. |
| Linker retired (session 25) | Replaced by `src/plugins/auto-internal-links/index.mjs` (build-time rehype plugin). `link_utility.py` kept dormant in devnook root — delete after stable operation. |
| Content pipeline is external | No registry, no staging, no publish scripts in this repo. `src/content/` is written by `../devnook_content_workspace/agents/publish/publish.py` via cross-repo git push. |
