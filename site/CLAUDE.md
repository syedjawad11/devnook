# DevNook — Claude Session Log (Dev Workspace)

> Always read this file first at the start of a new session. Updated at end of every session.
> **Content pipeline lives in `../devnook_content_workspace/`** — no pipeline code or registry in this repo.

## Session start — do NOT auto-read these files

Unless explicitly asked, do not open:

- `archives/decisions-archive.md` (on demand only)
- Prior chat transcripts or session history

Start each session from this file + MEMORY.md only.

## Project Overview

**DevNook** (devnook.dev) — developer resource site, 1,000+ programmatic posts + 18 client-side browser tools, monetized via AdSense (deferred until 50k visitors/month).

**Stack:** Astro + Cloudflare Pages. Content is published by `../devnook_content_workspace/` via PAT.
**Repo:** `main` branch, Cloudflare Pages auto-deploy on every push.

## Last Session (2026-05-23, #50)

**Status:** ✅ seo-optimizer pipeline tested end-to-end. `python-string-methods-cheatsheet` rewritten, built, pushed, and live.

### What was done in #50

- **seo-optimizer end-to-end test**: Ran full pipeline on `python-string-methods-cheatsheet` — keyword research (DataForSEO), rewrite, build verify, commit, push.
- **Article rewritten**: 919 → 1,380 words. Primary keyword `python string methods` (vol: 2,900, diff: 59). First H2 contains keyword. 5 internal links woven in. Tables and code blocks expanded.
- **Two bugs caught and fixed**:
  - Description was 168 chars (over 160 limit) — agent self-reported 157 incorrectly. Always verify with `len()` in Python.
  - YAML parse error: unquoted description containing `: ` broke js-yaml at build time. Fixed by wrapping in double quotes.
- **Build passed** (109 pages, no errors). Commit `79e6173` pushed to `origin main`. Cloudflare auto-deploy triggered.
- **Live URL**: `https://devnook.dev/cheatsheets/python-string-methods-cheatsheet`
- **Registry updated** in `../devnook_content_workspace/agents/content-team/registry.db` — title, description, keyword, updated_at.

### Key learnings from #50

- Custom subagents (`seo-optimizer`, `gsc-analyst`, etc.) are NOT built-in agent types — invoke as `general-purpose` with full instructions embedded in the prompt.
- Always verify description length with Python `len()` — agent self-reported counts are unreliable.
- Any frontmatter value containing `: ` (colon + space) must be wrapped in double quotes to avoid YAML parse errors at build time.
- PowerShell here-strings use `@'...'@` syntax — bash-style `cat <<'EOF'` is invalid in PowerShell.

### Previous session (#49) summary

GSC MCP fully verified end-to-end. Live site data: 15 clicks, 3,267 impressions, 0.46% CTR, avg position 29.8. Built 7 subagents in `../devnook_content_workspace/.claude/agents/` (content-planner, content-writer, content-ingest, antigravity-qa, content-publisher, gsc-analyst, seo-optimizer).

### Next session priorities (#51)

1. **Scale seo-optimizer** — run on more articles from the registry. Feed GSC quick_wins list to prioritize which slugs to rewrite first. Invoke `@gsc-analyst REPORT_TYPE=quick_wins` first, then batch `@seo-optimizer` on top 5.
2. **Deferred from #44** — FAQPage schema validation in Google Rich Results Test, add FAQs to 3 skipped tools (`meta-tag-generator`, `readme-generator`, `sitemap-generator-from-url`).
3. **GSC ping fix** — set `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` secret in content workspace GitHub repo secrets to stop cron "Skipping GSC ping" noise.

### Deferred (do not do)

- **AdSense integration** — revisit only at 50k visitors/month
- **GSC ping** — `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` secret never set in content workspace repo; every cron run prints "Skipping GSC ping". Non-blocking config gap — defer to a dedicated session.
- Blog filter chips wiring (decorative only)
- Search bar wiring (`SearchBar.astro` parked)

## Key Paths

- Astro site: `src/`
- Layouts: `src/layouts/`
- Content: `src/content/` (written by content workspace publisher)
- Components: `src/components/`
- Global styles: `public/styles/` (NOT src/styles/)
- Tools: `src/pages/tools/[slug].astro` + `public/tools/*.html`
- Auto-internal-links plugin: `src/plugins/auto-internal-links/index.mjs`
- Related callouts plugin: `src/plugins/related-callouts/index.mjs`
- Dev subagent: `agents/subagent-prompts/builder.md`
- Dev skills: `agents/skills/astro-conventions.md`, `agents/skills/tool-build-patterns.md`
- SEO audit script: `scripts/seo_audit.py` — run with `D:\miniconda3\python.exe scripts/seo_audit.py`
- Trailing slash fixer: `scripts/fix_trailing_slashes.py` — run with `D:\miniconda3\python.exe scripts/fix_trailing_slashes.py`
- SEO audit log: `auditlog.md` — issues, verdicts, session fix plan (read before #37+)

## Dev Subagent

```
ORCHESTRATOR (Sonnet main session)
  └── Builder (Sonnet) — agents/subagent-prompts/builder.md
      Handles: Astro edits, new tools, npm run build verification
```

Spawn with: `Agent(prompt=open('agents/subagent-prompts/builder.md').read(), ...)`

**Workflow B** — new tool: Orchestrator → Builder → review + commit
**Workflow C** — bug fix: Orchestrator → Builder → review + commit

## Important Decisions Log

> Live guardrails — if you forget these, you will break something.

| Decision | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| No Tailwind | All styles in `tokens.css` custom properties |
| All tools client-side only | 18 tools, no Workers, no AI-powered tools |
| Static output (not hybrid) | `output: 'static'`, no adapter — satori crashes Workers runtime |
| Global CSS in `public/styles/` not `src/styles/` | Astro only copies `public/` to `dist/`; absolute `/styles/*` refs need public/ |
| PostCard prop is `href` not `slug` | All 5 call sites use `href`; never rename to slug/url/path |
| `tools/[slug].astro` uses `import.meta.glob` | Dynamic `await import()` crashes Vite static analysis |
| Never call `build-tool.py build_tool()` for existing tools | Writes page that collides with dynamic route — use `generate_seo_explainer()` + `write_file()` |
| Auto internal links plugin (rehype, build-time) | `src/plugins/auto-internal-links/index.mjs`; `autoAnchors: true`; `devnookUrlBuilder` required — language concept URLs use `frontmatter.language`+`frontmatter.concept`, NOT filename |
| Use `@astrojs/sitemap@3.2.1` not custom | Custom sitemap was broken; v3.7+ incompatible with Astro 4.x. Current version generates `sitemap-0.xml` (0-indexed) — do not expect `sitemap-1.xml` |
| Related posts auto-derived at render time (session 27) | `src/layouts/PostLayout.astro` builds the related list from `getCollection()` using a language/category/tags score — never from a hand-written `## Related` markdown section. `frontmatter.related_posts` is unused; leave as `[]`. |
| Linker retired (session 25) | Replaced by `src/plugins/auto-internal-links/index.mjs` (build-time rehype plugin). `link_utility.py` kept dormant in devnook root — delete after stable operation. |
| Content pipeline is external | No registry, no staging, no publish scripts in this repo. `src/content/` is written by `../devnook_content_workspace/agents/publish/publish.py` via cross-repo git push. |
| Language post URLs must use `concept`, not filename | Content pipeline agents historically guessed `/languages/{lang}/{filename-slug}` in body prose. Correct path is always `/languages/{lang}/{concept}` from registry. `publish.py` now has `validate_language_links()` guard that skips files with filename-based links at publish time. `link_utility.py._url_for_row()` is already correct — the bug is agents bypassing it. |
| Auto-internal-links plugin covers all categories | `src/plugins/auto-internal-links/index.mjs` scans the full `contentDir` via `fast-glob` — all of `guides`, `blog`, `cheatsheets`, `languages`. Not language-only. `devnookUrlBuilder` note only describes URL *generation* for language posts. |
| Related callouts plugin (session 32) | `src/plugins/related-callouts/index.mjs` — build-time rehype plugin injects up to 3 `<aside class="related-callout">` nodes at interior H2 boundaries. Scoring mirrors PostLayout.astro. CSS in `public/styles/global.css` (not scoped). Per-post opt-out: `excludeRelatedCallouts: true` in frontmatter. |
| No H1 in markdown body (session 42) | `PostLayout.astro` renders `frontmatter.title` as the page `<h1>`. Any `# Title` line in the body creates a second `<h1>` — Ahrefs flags as "Multiple H1 tags". Content pipeline files patched: `writer.md`, `antigravity-qa.md`, `seo-writing-rules.md`. Never write or instruct agents to write a body H1. |
| Never use `[skip ci]` in devnook commit messages (session 43) | Cloudflare Pages honors `[skip ci]` and skips the build — so drip-publish commits would never deploy. The `[skip ci]` in `drip-publish.yml` line 78 is intentional (content-workspace side, prevents workflow retriggering itself). The devnook-side commit in `publish.py` must NOT include it. |
